Tasks
-----

Tasks typically contain:
- References to emails
- Other components

When a new email is received, a new task is created by a special
client if a filter matches it.  A completed task is resurrected if the
email refers to an email that was part of that task's list of
contained emails.  This is all done by one or more clients that just
happen to feel like managing this stuff.
