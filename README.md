## Description

Hello.  This set of programs is MailTask.  This is a brief document
intending to familiarize users with how to use this program.

MailTask is a suite of three related programs.  They are `server.py`,
`client.py`, and `mt_scrtry_rn.py`.  These will be referred to as the
server, the client, and the utility client, respectively.

To use the server, you create an empty directory and put a file called
`ACCOUNT_INFO` with the servers, usernames, and passwords of the
accounts you intend to use with MailTask in that directory.  You then
create the Tasks folder as well as `*/INBOX` and `*/Sent`, where `*` is
every number from 0 up to but not including the number of accounts you
put in `ACCOUNT_INFO`.  You should also create an empty file called
`ADDRESSBOOK` and a `Tasks/BLACKHOLE` file containing roughly the
following:
```
Content-Type: multipart/x.MailTask;
 boundary="===============4405596723705947737=="
Date: Thursday, 1 Jan 1970 00:00:00 -0000
Subject: BLACKHOLE
X-MailTask-Type: Checklist
X-MailTask-Completion-Status: Incomplete

--===============4405596723705947737==
Content-Type: text/plain


--===============4405596723705947737==--
```

You then start the server in that directory, passing it two parameters
indicating the ports you want to use to communicate with the client.

Each client, and the utility client, should be set up a similar way.
See the source for the utility client for additional ways to configure
the utility client; each user will probably have a slightly different
use case for how to use the utility client and may even want to modify
the utility client to behave differently.  The utility client is a
client, but it automatically creates tasks based on incoming emails,
marks tasks done when they are finished, and can be configured to
ignore certain accounts or folders.

Be aware that the server will mark all emails in an account as red
when it first runs.  Be also aware that it will take a VERY long time
to download all emails the first time a client is run.  For large
accounts, it may be necessary to manually copy over the server's
downloaded emails in these cases (contained in the `*/{INBOX,Sent}`
folders).

## Requirements
1)  Python 2  
2)  FLTK / pyfltk  
3)  cPickle (falls back to pickle if not found)  
4)  ???  

Anecdotal note about pyfltk: easiest way to get is to install with the Debian
`python-fltk` package.  Using pip with a requirements.txt file with pyFltk
got me in a world of pain, since it didn't like the package names that pyFltk uses.

I may add more documentation here later, but that's it for now.  Enjoy!
