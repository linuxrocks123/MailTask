Case breakdown (head of stack is listed last):

Viewing a folder: [(FOLDER,"string containing pathname of folder")]

(This state never reached; UI automatically opens body upon descent
into message)
Viewing a message: [(FOLDER,"string containing name of folder"),
                    (MESSAGE,"UIDpath",Message object containing MIME tree of message)]

Viewing headers of a message ("Metadata" of single task):
        [(FOLDER,"string containing name of folder"),
         (MESSAGE,Message object containing MIME tree of message,"UIDpath"),
         (HEADERS)]

Viewing attachments of message:
        [(FOLDER,"string containing name of folder"),
         (MESSAGE,Message object containing MIME tree of message,"UIDpath"),
         (ATTACHMENTS)]

Viewing single attachment of message:
        [(FOLDER,"string containing name of folder"),
         (MESSAGE,Message object containing MIME tree of message,"UIDpath"),
         (ATTACHMENTS),
         (SUBMESSAGE,sub-Message object containing viewed component of message)]

Viewing non-header component of message (body):
        [(FOLDER,"string containing name of folder"),
         (MESSAGE,Message object containing MIME tree of message,"UIDpath"),
         (SUBMESSAGE,sub-Message object containing viewed component of message)]

Viewing RELATED messages ("Emails" component of single task):
        [(FOLDER,"string containing name of folder"),
         (MESSAGE,Message object containing MIME tree of message,"UIDpath"),

Viewing single related message (state never reached):
        [(FOLDER,"string containing name of folder"),
         (MESSAGE,Message object containing MIME tree of message,"UIDpath"),
         (RELATED),
         (MESSAGE,Message object containing MIME tree of related message,"UIDpath")]

        [(FOLDER,"string containing name of folder"),
         (MESSAGE,Message object containing MIME tree of message,"UIDpath"),
         (DRAFTS)]

Viewing single "Drafts" message component (state never reached):
